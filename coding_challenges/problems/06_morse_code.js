// Build a function, `morseEncode(str)` that takes in a string (no
// numbers or punctuation) and outputs the morse code for it. See
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code. Put two spaces between
// words and one space between letters.
//
// You'll have to type in morse code: I'd use an object to map letters to
// codes. Don't worry about numbers.
//
// I wrote a helper method `morseEncodeWord(word)` that handled a
// single word.
