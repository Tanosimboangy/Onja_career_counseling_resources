May 31, 2021

**Personal questions and responses**



1. **Tell me about yourself**: Name is Rinon, I come from Madagascar, FT developer at Onja. After high school he was selected to be part of Onja, out of 200,000 students. Started English in 2019, just achieved C1 English level for proficient level. After a year of English they did programming, HTML 5, styling with CSS and SaaS, libraries like Bootstrap, Javascript, react, including Redux typescript. Also done testing. Have built more than 80 projects, including web projects and mobile app projects. Currently working on open source project which has 50,000 people called Gophrs.  Gophrs has a lot of projects that developers can work on, including backend and front end stuff. It’s helped him build his skills. It’s incredible because he can learn more and it helps with his communication.
2. **Favorite part of being a  programmer**: The ability to learn every day. There are a lot of technologies and his favorite is javascript. 
3. **Why are you interested in this position?** Interested in this position because what they are doing is really important for the world, it makes a big impact on the world, taking care of patients, providing consultation and prescriptions. That’s the reason why he is interested, he wants to make a big impact on the world. 
4. **Tell me about a time you experienced failure? How did you overcome or respond?** The first time I started learning English during the first semester, the first 3 months I couldn’t pass the English exam. I was very disappointed, but I was not discouraged, it was very hard for me because before finishing high school I had never failed with exams. This was the first time and it was a pain. What I did was try to learn more at home on my phone and did research and doing research and exam practice. Now I have passed all of my English. 
5. **What accomplishment is your greatest source of pride?** I was introducing myself and talking about C1 English level. It’s the achievement that I am most proud of. In Madagascar, not a lot of people can achieve C1 English level, because it’s hard to teach English here. We have a difficulty in finding resources like finding native speakers. 
6. **How do you handle difficult people in the workplace?** That is true that when you are working with people, there may be difficult people. We have to handle them. I would approach them and try to talk to them and try to understand what they want to do and understand why they are difficult, try to think from their perspectives. It’s all about communication. When we communicate with each other we can understand each other. 
7. **What’s your biggest weakness?** Biggest weakness is that I am too self-critical, I think. Sometimes when I am doing a project or a task that has been assigned to me, I try to do my best to accomplish the task, but I always feel that I have done better. The problem is when I can’t stop thinking about it, it can cause stress, and it can make me feel regretful. It can also make me look down on myself. I work on this by allocating time for going over the project before finishing it. Let’s say I have two hours left, I can dedicate those two hours for cleaning up and doing code refactoring. It’s good because it can help you improve yourself.
8. **What skills do you hope to acquire in the near future?** Now I am a front end developer, and I develop with HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the future I am thinking of acquiring a new language which is a backend language like PHP for example, I want to be a full stack developer so I can do backend projects and frontend projects at the same time. 

**Situational Questions**



1. **What is the most exciting technical challenge you've ever worked on?** Application called Country Quiz, app that enables users to use a quiz to solidify their knowledge about capitals and countries around the world. In this app, they can see a question on the top of the app and there are four options. The questions ask for a capital name or a flag. The user can pick an answer, if it’s right they can see the next question. I used Javascript for this application, and React. Up to this time I hadn’t learned Redux yet so I used context API. I also implemented some CSS and styled components when styling the app. At the end I finished and it helped me learn more about context API and the browser API called Fitch. 
2. **Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a project**. I can remember one now. We built an app called something jobs (I didn’t catch the exact name). It’s an app that we had to display all the jobs that are available for the users. The API has more than 50 jobs in the data, so it would not be good to display all 50 jobs at the same time. It was not required to use pagination but I did it to limit the jobs displayed on the page. I sorted it by just 5 jobs. I thought it was not good to have all the jobs on one page because it would render and the page would be so slow first if the user is waiting for the full list. You want your users to be able to access your page.
3. **Tell me about a time when you got stuck on a technical problem**. **How do you overcome it?** I have been stuck a lot of times when I am building an application, but the first time I tried to use create React app, it was hard for me to install it with MPM. I tried to install it for a half day and then I asked our mentor here but we couldn’t solve it. I did a lot of research on the internet, I did React documentation and stack overflow. I couldn’t manage to install it. I came up with an idea of deleting the package.json and tried to uninstall all of the packages I installed before, and instead used something similar to MPM (I didn’t catch the exact name) and succeeded in installing it. 
4. **Tell me about a time you had to present a technical subject to your colleagues. How did you prepare?** I have done it twice, the last time I did it I had to talk about our functions versus regular functions. I was asked to talk about it with my classmates and some of the teachers there. I usually do research when I don’t understand something. I knew how it worked, but I wanted to explain it well to them. I’m not used to talking publicly and presenting for a lot of people. I watched Youtube videos in order to help me explain it, and I used documentation like MDN in order to explain it. The presentation went well and everyone understood what I wanted to say because I had three days to prepare for it. I wrote down everything I wanted to say. 
5. **Tell me about the web development project you’re least proud of. What would you do differently?** Can I think about this for a moment? I would say a web app I’m least proud of is called Hit something (I didn’t catch the exact name), it has a lot of songs and lyrics. We were asked to build a project that gets lyrics from the internet and enables users to add an artist and song. I’m not as proud of it because first I couldn’t finish it because we didn’t have enough time, but also I couldn’t use context API, Redux, we just used one file for all of the projects. If someone has a look at it they wouldn’t understand what I did even though I added a lot of comments there. If I had to rebuild it, I would use Redux in order to avoid problems and manage my states in one place. I could make the code much cleaner. If I had to build a similar one in the future, I would take those into consideration. How can I manage my states, make my code cleaner and understandable for other people.

**Experience-based Questions**



1. **Tell me about your coursework at Onja.** At Onja we focus on English and coding. We study from Monday - Saturday, every day we learn English but most of the time we dedicate our time to computer programming. We have teachers here for English and programming mentors. Also they teach us new skills. We always have projects to solidify our skills and help prepare us for the future. 
2. **Tell me about your experience using GitHub**. I am hosting my projects on Github and most of the projects we build are hosted on Github.
3. **Tell me about your UI/UX experience (He asked for clarification on what this question means so I reframed it as “What is your philosophy around building user friendly apps?”). I **focus on accessibility, it’s important that users can access your apps easily. When you have tabs and use the keyboards to navigate through the tabs. I don’t like when a page is slow or has a lot of bugs. Sometimes when you inspect a website you see a lot of errors there. I don’t think that’s a good idea. Users will quit if it’s slow.  \
 							

**Context-based Questions**



1. **How do you prepare for a project?** (Context: Waterfall product manager) I prepare for a project by first understanding all of the requirements. When you have a project that has a lot of requirements, I read these all and understand these. If I don’t understand I would ask someone to help me with that. Once I understand, if we are not given a design, I would do some drawing maybe to use my imagination for the app. When that’s finished, I create a repository and clone it. When that is finished I can think about the steps I can take to build the app. Once I have done those steps then I can start diving into coding. 
2. **How do you approach debugging code?** (Context: Agile product manager) I can start with problems I have in my code, I usually use a debugging tool and add a debugger in the logics in order to see what’s going on in the code. If I can’t fix it with that, I use logs for everything. If I can’t fix it with that, I do research, I use stack overflow for a long time. Talking about pull requests, when someone reviews my code and they think I can still optimize by code or improve, I always ask because it can be hard to understand what people mean. 
3. **Say I needed you to learn something quickly for a major assignment. How would you go about learning that subject?** (Context: Web developer) I believe it’s not too hard for me to learn things quickly. When we look back at the amount of time we learned English and coding at Onja we didn’t have a lot of time. We had to be diligent, we had to have some commitment. I would use my skills of resilience and trying to be resilient and learn quickly by using the internet. We have a lot of resources here. We can read a book if it includes what we want to learn. We can ask teachers and mentors. 
4. **How do you prefer to fetch data from an API?** (Context: Web developer) Most of the time I use fetch API and browser API, sometimes I use the gate method or Axios. Most of the time I use fetch with a async await.  \
