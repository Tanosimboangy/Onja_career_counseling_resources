# Onja Communication Guide: Lesson Plan

**Summary**

Onja is a fusion of two cultures - Malagasy Culture and Western Culture. We try to take the
best of each. In practice we tend to lean towards western culture when it comes to
professionalism (including communication) and theMalagasy culture for general life.

Because of this, Onja staff need a strong understandingof western communication style.
Students/developers in particular need a very strong understanding of western
communication since they work in European tech teams.

**Communication principles**

Here are some key principles to brief you and prepare you for this kind of communication:

In written and verbal communication be:

* Very direct and concise (this can feel rude in Malagasyculture so might take some
getting used to)
* Accurate
* Honest
* Specific and complete

**Examples**

Here are some examples with colleagues Narovana, Racheltalking to each other. They
might refer to some other colleugues Mike and Toky:

**Example 1 - Directness**

Narovana: “What is the update on the book I orderedfrom Amazon?”
Rachel: “So... I went to Tana two weeks ago and whileI was there I asked Mike to check at
Kolinaka and while he was there he saw several customsofficers then found out that the
book is being held up in customs ”

Here Rachel is not being direct. From a western communicationperspective this can be very
frustrating since a) it takes a lot of time and b)it takes a lot of concentration to understand
the story. To be direct it’s a good idea to “ _put firstthings first”._ This involves puting the most
important information first and following up withthe less important information (or even
leaving it out entirely).

Instead Rachel could reply:
“It’s being held up in customs. Mike found that outwhen he went to Kolinaka’s a couple of
weeks ago” _- (this is putting first things first)_


Or
“It’s being held up in customs.”

**Example 2 - Accuracy**

Narovana: “Do Mike and Toky know that they need totrain the new cook?”
Rachel: “Yes, I shared the document with them.”

Here Rachel is not being accurate so this can makeher misleading. “Yes” means that Mike
and Toky know so Rachel should only use “Yes” if sheknows they know. And sharing a
document can be done in many ways - It might be a10 page document with just two lines on
upskilling cooks that was shared with no instructions.

Instead Rachel could reply:
“They should know since I shared the cook upskillingdocument with them and explained that
they have a role to play”

**Example 3 - Honesty**

Narovana: Do you know if the cooking document hasbeen updated?
Rachel: “mm” (and nods her head to confirm)

Rachel is not actually sure if the document has beenupdated so she doesn’t say strong
“Yes” but gives a weaker yes. This is a problem sinceNarovana now believes that Rachel is
sure that the document has been updated. Narovanamight make some bad decisions based
on this incorrect information.

Instead Rachel should say:
“I am not sure”.

This might be rude in Malagasy culture but in westernculture it is not rude at all but
expected.

**Example 4 Specific**

Rachel and Narovana have been looking into buyingethernet cables from a supplier in
Supreme center. They have two different brands - Abbaand Yolo and each brand has
several different lengths 2m, 4m and 10m. In the lastconversation Rachel and Narovana
had they were mostly focused on Yolo 2m lengths.

Rachel sends a message to Narovana: “Hi Narovana,I have an update on the ethernet
cables. The cost is 6000.” Rachel has an idea Narovanais probably talking about the 2m
Yolo cables since thats what they discussed last butshe is not entirely sure so she replies
“Which brand/length?”. Then Rachel replies “Yolo 2m”.From a western communication
perspective Rachel was not specific enough and thisis a big problem because: a) She is


forcing Narovana to think on her behalf and check her work b) If Narovana is in a hurry she
might make an assumption without clarifying and thiscould lead to a bad decision c) it takes
a lot of time and frustration: Narovana has to readthe first message, then think, then reply,
then wait (perhaps hours) for Rachel to read the message,then Rachel must think, then
reply. Now Narovana has to read again. This mightuse up to 3 minutes of Narovana’s time -
and hours of waiting. Whereas if Rachel just put ina little more thought into her
communication it would take just 5 seconds for Narovanato read the message and reply
“thanks.”

Instead Rachel should have written:
“Hi Narovana, I have an update on the ethernet cables.The cost for Yolo 2m cables is
6000Ar.”

Note also that currency should be clarified. “Ar” takes very little effort to write and ensures
that the currency is Ar, not Franc or Euros or otherwise.

**Example 5**

Narovana: Are you done with the login form?
Rachael: Yes, I’ve done the form and have built twocomponents and have even tested them
but just have the buttons left.

This is not honest. “Yes” means yes.

Instead Rachel should say:
“No, but I am about 90% complete - just the buttonsto go.”
