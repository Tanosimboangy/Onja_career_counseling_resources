## Career Counselor guide
<br/>


**Introduction**



---


Onja and all its students deeply acknowledge your kindness to help and your commitment to provide career counseling. Your invaluable work is crucial for us and will have a real impact on our students’ future as well as for those who will follow them. Thank you so much for making this happen. 

This document was created as a simple guide for Career Counselors to have an idea of what is expected from you. Note that this is just a guide and is not exhaustive.

Should you have any questions, please contact Piero: [piero.pretto@onja.org](mailto:piero.pretto@onja.org)

**Your mentees**

---




* Mostly female, all African and from underprivileged backgrounds.
* Each mentee graduated high school in the top 1% of their peers and were selected for our programme from an initial pool of 200,000 students.
* They have spent over 4,000 hours learning and writing HTML5, JavaScript, React, Redux, TypeScript and React Native. You can find samples of their work [here](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka).
* They have achieved advanced English level (IELTS 7 to 9).
* Each mentee has performed 2-4 mock interviews with staff.
* Mentees have a broad understanding of agile development practices.
* Students regularly practice Codewar challenges.

**My Role as a Career Counselor**

---




* Perform mock interviews.
* Following mock interview practice, provide a written appraisal on the mentees performance and areas for improvements.
* Talk about your own professional experiences.
* Mentees might have questions about the interviewing process and you should try to help them answer those questions.
* **Provide a weekly schedule of your volunteer availability.** In conjunction, your mentees will reach out to you to request an appointment during your times of availability. You can increase/decrease your availability according to what is most helpful and works for you and mentees. 
* Provide, if any, written insight or ideas on how we can improve interview preparation for all mentees at Onja.

**Time commitment**



* Meeting with their mentees **once a week ** OR **once per two weeks** on Zoom or Google Meet, depending on your availability.

**Other information**

**Schedule Availability**



* Mentees abide by a strict schedule. Here are the following times when they are available for appointments:
    * Monday-Friday between 7am-5pm.
    * Saturday between 8am-4pm.
* Our time zone is East African Time (GMT+3)
* Appointments should not last longer than an hour.

**Communication methods**



* Emails, Slack, Facebook and Google drive.
* Google Meet or Zoom (to be organised between students and Career Counselors).

**Communication advice**



* Maintain a positive and professional relationship with your mentees. 
* Encourage your mentees to ask questions.
* Be aware that mentees have a different cultural background and this can sometimes create misunderstandings however they are looking forward to familiarizing themselves with your culture so please don’t hesitate to explain things that you normally wouldn’t.
* Don’t worry that you have a very different lifestyle than your mentee. If you had a big pizza for dinner you can share that freely, and your mentee won’t be offended. They already understand this. 
* Please don’t offer to send anything to your mentee (money or otherwise). While intentions may be good, there are many drawbacks that don’t align well with Onja’s values. Namely:
    * Perpetuates unhealthy views on dependencies on foreigners (Onja in comparison will be self-funded by the work of Malagasy people)
    * A gift may be _‘nothing’ _to a foreigner but expensive to Malagasy people, exasperating the rich-poor divide and creating an uneven relationship. 
    * It can sometimes be offensive
    * Fairness between students

Please reach out to Onja staffer [Mitantsoa](mailto:mitantsoa@onja.org) if you need more information on this.

**Examples of mock interview exercises**



* Open discussion interview
    * Example:
        * [Asking a mix of personal, experience-based and technical questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCl7RGd9-hpVHZtFbrzsqGSRKaWG4OS-mfFBO_cY7S8/edit?usp=sharing).
        * [Mock technical interview on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=057Rs6CgJnY&t=324s).
* Having your mentee to explain or demo coding projects.
    * Examples:
        * Having them explain one of their projects inside their portfolio.
        * Having them read and explain code from a project you’ve worked on.
* Asking a mentee to perform a code assessment live on Codepen
    * Examples:
        * [Mock React.js Coding Interview on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnkrDse9QKc)
        * [Coderbyte React Button toggle challenge](https://coderbyte.com/editor/frontend:React%20Button%20Toggle)
    * NOT an example:
        * Giving them a week-long coding challenge. Students operate under a tight schedule that makes additional homework difficult.
