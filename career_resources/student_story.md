# Student story: Rinon

I come from a small town on the national road between Antananarivo and the East coast. My parents farm the land. My mother sells rice and pasta too at different markets in the region. And my father is also a carpenter.

I wasn’t particularly good at school but when I saw how difficult it was for my parents to pay my school fees it motivated me to study hard. I was good at physics, it was my favourite subject. English was not my best subject though, because I couldn’t attend all the English lessons. If I had, I would have missed French class, which I preferred to English.

<br/>
After finishing high school, I stayed with my family for a while and helped them farm the land. Then I found a job in a wood factory and moved to Moramanga. I worked there for a short time before starting to study IT and psychology at a private school. But I only studied for 7 months before I had to stop because the fees were too high.

I moved back to my hometown to become a teacher, but then I got invited to come to Onja. Now I am at Onja I am enjoying studying English very much!”
