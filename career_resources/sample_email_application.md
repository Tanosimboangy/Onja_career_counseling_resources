**A little bit about me**

* Through a social enterprise called [Onja](http://onja.org/), I have been taught frontend development by programmers with a combined 35 years of experience: [Shaun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndorfin/) trained me in CSS3 & HTML5, [Loic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loic-lepinois/?originalSubdomain=be) in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Redux and [Andrzej](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzej-wower-4912a659/) in React Native and agile development.

**A little bit about Onja**

My developer journey has been sponsored by [Onja](https://onja.org/), a social enterprise that trains underprivileged students in English and software development. Onja provides me with the following ongoing services:



* They handle payroll and handle any administrative tasks that go into hiring remote staff.
